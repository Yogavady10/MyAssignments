Recap
	
	What diff API vs webservices
			- communication happens two systems via API (with/witout internet) (apache poi)
			webservices - only with internet (all our apps)
			
	why do we need to do API TEsting
			- early testing        - aPI will developed at the begining
			- faster			   - no rendering
			- api based apps       - now a days all the applications are built with aPI
			- less failures(script)- we dont face the scripting issues like element not found, timing issues
			- data generation	   - we can create data with less time 
			- easier and isolated  - applications are built independently
			
			
			public class sample
			package name recommendation - lowercase
			method name - camelCase - sampleTest - fdhfkjdhfjdkh
			
	Http methods
			- get - read/retrive
			- post- creation
			- put - updates the entire record
			- patch- parital update
			- delete- deletion
			
			
	response code series
				1xx - information
				2xx - success
				3xx - redirects
				4xx - client errors
				5xx - server errors
				
				
	Five step process
				- requirement
				- endpoint ( server + port + resources)
				- Add request (authentication / content type/headers/cookies)
				- send request (http methods like get,post etc)
				- validate the response
				
	Authentication
				- basic ( username + password)
				- no authentication
				- Oauth 2.0
				- Token 
				
	IAAS vs PAAS vs SAAS
			cloud
			IAAS - infra structure as service - AWS,Azure and GCP
			PAAS - Platform as service - AWS RDS
			SAAS - software as service  - gmail 
			
			
			curl - request/response
			
			GET - 
			
			REquirement - 
			
			Wrapper - 
			GEt all the things 				-  seelct * from table
			number, sys_id and category 	-  select number,sys_id,category from table
			flter with category         	-  select number,sys_id,category from table where category = software
			
			
			Post 
					- body is mandatory
					
					service now post
							- without body 
							- with body (as string)
							- with body via file (external) - industry standard
