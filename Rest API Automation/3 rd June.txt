				API Based Apps
				Faster
				Easier and Isolated
				Data Generation
				Less Failures
				early testing
				
				
				any application development 
				1. Database
				2. API 
				3. middelware
				4. UI
				
				monolithic vs microservices
					
					monotlithic
							- amazon e commerce
								- clothes
								- electronics
								- households - no SQL
								- payment
								- one database
										tables for clothes, elec etcc - oracle
										
					microservices
						- independent
								- clothes are inde - its own DB - oracle
								- electronics - mongoDB
								- SAAS
				API Based Apps
				
								- all the apps are API BAsed
								- going for SAAS
								
				PAAS Vs IAAS Vs SAAS - 
						
						
				API Based Apps - all the apps/webpage are API based
				Faster
						- no rendering involved
				Easier and Isolated
								bookmyshow - 
								monolithic vs microservices
				Data Generation
								- faker API- data generation
				Less Failures
								- almost never fails
				early testing
						- before UI 
						
						
				more API Tests - 60 to 75 %
				UI - 40 to 25%
				
				5 step process
						- REquirement
						- Endpoint
						- Add Request
						- send REquest
						- validate the response
						
						
				Get

					Instance URL: https://dev117892.service-now.com/
					Username: admin
					Password: pQ*WNhtb3U8$
					
					
					
			postman - api testing tool
			send the rewquest
			get the response
			
			
			resource for servicenow for incident - api/now/table/incident
			
			get the details of all the tickets
			
			collection - group of requests
				Postman 
						
						5 step process
						- REquirement   - done
						- Endpoint      - (server+port +resources)https://dev117892.service-now.com/api/now/table/incident
						- Add Request   - Headers + Authorization + Request Query / body 
											
						- send REquest  - 
						- validate the response
						
						
						sys_id - servicenow
						
						
						CAUTION - SAVE your PostMAn Requests always
						
						
						Assignment
						1. PAAS Vs IAAS Vs SAAS - difference with examples
						2. make a get call to the servicenow instance in postman
