Java Challenge (2/20)

Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.

Java Challenge (5/20)

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: false

Java Problem (10/20)

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

Java Problem (11/20)

Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, return the first letter to appear twice.

Note:

A letter a appears twice before another letter b if the second occurrence of a is before the second occurrence of b.
s will contain at least one letter that appears twice.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abccbaacz"
Output: "c"
Explanation:
The letter 'a' appears on the indexes 0, 5 and 6.
The letter 'b' appears on the indexes 1 and 4.
The letter 'c' appears on the indexes 2, 3 and 7.
The letter 'z' appears on the index 8.
The letter 'c' is the first letter to appear twice, because out of all the letters the index of its second occurrence is the smallest.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcdd"
Output: "d"
Explanation:
The only letter that appears twice is 'd' so we return 'd'.


Java Problem (12/20)

Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique, or false otherwise.

Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true



Java Problem (13/20)

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.

Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.

 

Example 1:

Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.
Example 2:

Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]
Output: 3
Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words. 
In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.






Java Problem (15/20)

Given two string arrays word1 and word2, return true if the two arrays represent the same string, and false otherwise.

A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.

Example 1:

Input: word1 = ["ab", "c"], word2 = ["a", "bc"]
Output: true
Explanation:
word1 represents string "ab" + "c" -> "abc"
word2 represents string "a" + "bc" -> "abc"
The strings are the same, so return true.
Example 2:

Input: word1 = ["a", "cb"], word2 = ["ab", "c"]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: word1  = ["abc", "d", "defg"], word2 = ["abcddefg"]
Output: true

Java Problem (18/20)

A distinct string is a string that is present only once in an array.

Given an array of strings arr, and an integer k, return the kth distinct string present in arr. If there are fewer than k distinct strings, return an empty string "".

Note that the strings are considered in the order in which they appear in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = ["d","b","c","b","c","a"], k = 2
Output: "a"
Explanation:
The only distinct strings in arr are "d" and "a".
"d" appears 1st, so it is the 1st distinct string.
"a" appears 2nd, so it is the 2nd distinct string.
Since k == 2, "a" is returned. 
Example 2:

Input: arr = ["aaa","aa","a"], k = 1
Output: "aaa"
Explanation:
All strings in arr are distinct, so the 1st string "aaa" is returned.
Example 3:

Input: arr = ["a","b","a"], k = 3
Output: ""
Explanation:
The only distinct string is "b". Since there are fewer than 3 distinct strings, we return an empty string "".
